  Hello, traveler!

  Greetings and salutations!

  Ahoy matey!

  Have you heard of Among Us?

  Istanbul was Constantinople. Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople. Been a long time gone, Constantinople. Now it's Turkish delight on a moonlit night.

  I'm not cringe, you're cringe!

  Behold! The guttural effervescence of poignant stoicism!

  Help! They're after me!
return:
  Oh, it's you again.

  How goes your journey?

  Behold! The guttural effervescence of poignant stoicism!

  Yum these pretzels are good, want one?

  Did you know that there are some crazy monsters in this dungeon?

  Help! I'm going insane!
annoyed:
  Leave!

  What are you doing annoying me so much?

  Go eat a raincoat.

  I hope every puzzle you do has one extra piece - oh wait, I said it wrong again.

  You know what? With all these questions, I hope a rose-bellied ferret comes and eats you.
  
  You're pestering me almost as much as my ex-wife.
